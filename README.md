This is a code plug (configuration) for all three radios in the RMHam (https://www.rmham.org/) coverage area
This code plug REQUIRES that you put your call sign and DMR ID number in it to make it usable.
The F136 file is for use with the CPS software that Radioddity provides with the three radios.
The .json is for the CPEditor (https://www.cpeditor.co.uk/) that Radioddity recommends you use instead of their CP editor.
